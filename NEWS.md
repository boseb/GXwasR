## NEW FEATURES

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* This package implements various statistical genetics models for Genome-Wide Association (GWA) and X-Chromosome Wide Association (XWA) analyses in a sex-combined or sex-stratified way considering X-Chromosome Inactivation (XCI) pattern. In addition to association analysis, the package also enables testing for sex differences in genetic effects, including the implementation of specific models and applying best practices for additional quality control (QC) of genetic data required for these tests. The package includes twenty-five different functions in six different categories which enable a comprehensive pipeline for sex-aware genetic association analysis of common variants with unrelated individuals.
