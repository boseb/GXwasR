\title{QCsample2: Post-imputation quality control for samples in the plink binary files.}
\usage{
QCsample2(
  DataDir,
  ResultDir = tempdir(),
  finput,
  foutput,
  miss_geno = 0.1,
  het_Fstat = 0.2,
  small_sample_mod = FALSE,
  IBD = 0.2,
  ld_prunning = FALSE,
  highLD_regions,
  window_size = 50,
  step_size = 5,
  r2_threshold = 0.02,
  keep = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{DataDir}{A character string for the file path of the input PLINK binary files.}

\item{ResultDir}{A character string for the file path where all output files will be stored. The default is tempdir().}

\item{finput}{Character string, specifying the prefix of the input PLINK binary files with both male and female samples. This file needs to be in DataDir.}

\item{foutput}{Character string, specifying the prefix of the output PLINK binary files if filtering option for the samples is chosen.}

\item{miss_geno}{Numeric value between 0 to 1 for removing samples that have more than the specified missing genotype call rate. The default is 0.1.}

\item{het_Fstat}{Numeric value between 0 to 1 for removing samples that have more than the specified absolute value of the heterozygosity F statistic. The default is 0.2.}

\item{small_sample_mod}{Boolean value, TRUE or FALSE, specifying whether to use small sample modifier in heterozygocity computation or not. The default is FALSE. Allele frequencies are used in this calculation. Ideally, the sample size should not be small.}

\item{IBD}{Numeric value between 0 to 1 for removing samples that have more than the specified pi-hat value as a measure of IBD. The default is 0.2.}

\item{ld_prunning}{Boolean value, 'TRUE' or 'FALSE' for applying linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based filtering for IBD statistics computation. The default is FALSE. It is usually a good idea to perform some form of LD-based pruning before computing IBD statistics.}

\item{highLD_regions}{NULL or Character string, specifying the .txt file name with genomic regions with high LD. Based on a genome build Hg19 and Hg38, two files such as "high-LD-regions-hg19-GRCh37.txt" and "" are provided in "extdata" folder.}

\item{window_size}{Integer value, specifying a window size in variant count or kilobase for LD-based filtering. The default is 50.}

\item{step_size}{Integer value, specifying a variant count to shift the window at the end of each step for LD filtering. The default is 5.}

\item{r2_threshold}{Numeric value between 0 to 1 of pairwise r^2 threshold for LD-based filtering. The default is 0.02.}

\item{keep}{Boolean value, TRUE or FALSE, specifying whether to filter out the failed samples or just flag them. The default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A list of three dataframes, namely, Failedheter, Failedmissingness and Failedibd, containing samples that failed heterozygosity test, genotype call rate and IBD test, respectively. Each of these dataframes will have two columns, containing family id (FID) and individual id (IID).

If keep is FALSE, then the filtered output plink files with passed sample will be saved in the ResultDir.
}
\description{
This function finds and/or filters the samples with outlying heterozygosity, missing genotype rates and Identity By Descent (IBD).
