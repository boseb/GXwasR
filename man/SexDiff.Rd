\title{SexDiff: Sex difference in effect size for each SNP using t-test.}
\usage{
SexDiff(Mfile, Ffile)
}
\arguments{
\item{Mfile}{R dataframe of summary statistics of GWAS or XWAS of male samples with six mandatory columns, SNP(Variant),CHR(Chromosome number)
,BP(Base pair position),A1(Minor allele),BETA_M(Effect size) and SE_M(Standard error). This can be generated by running FM01comb or
FM02comb model with GXWAS function.}

\item{Ffile}{R dataframe of summary statistics of GWAS or XWAS of male samples with six mandatory columns, SNP(Variant),CHR(Chromosome number)
,BP(Base pair position),A1(Minor allele),BETA_F(Effect size) and SE_F(Standard error). This can be generated by running FM01comb or
FM02comb model with GXWAS function.}
}
\value{
R dataframe with seven columns, SNP(Variant),CHR(Chromosome number)
,BP(Base pair position),A1(Minor allele), tstat(t-statistics for effect-size test), P(p-value) and adjP (Bonferroni corrected p-value).
}
\description{
This function uses the GWAS summary statistics from sex-stratified tests like FM01comb or FM02comb, to evaluate the difference in effect size between males and females at each SNP using a t-test.

The input dataframes should only include X-chromosome in order to obtain results for sex differences based solely on X-linked loci.
}
\examples{
data("GXwasRData")
Difftest <- SexDiff(Mfile, Ffile)
significant_snps <- Difftest[Difftest$adjP < 0.05, ] # 9
