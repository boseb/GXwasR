\title{SexDiff: Sex difference in effect size for each SNP using t-test.}
\usage{
SexDiff(Mfile, Ffile)
}
\arguments{
\item{Mfile}{R dataframe of summary statistics of GWAS or XWAS of male samples with six mandatory columns, SNP(Variant),CHR(Chromosome number),
BP(Base pair position),A1(Minor allele),BETA_M(Effect size) and SE_M(Standard error). This can be generated by running FM01comb or
"FMstratified" model with GXWAS function.}

\item{Ffile}{R dataframe of summary statistics of GWAS or XWAS of male samples with six mandatory columns, SNP(Variant),CHR(Chromosome number),
BP(Base pair position),A1(Minor allele),BETA_F(Effect size) and SE_F(Standard error). This can be generated by running FM01comb or
"FMstratified" model with GXWAS function.}
}
\value{
R dataframe with seven columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{SNP} (Variant)
\item \code{CHR} (Chromosome number)
\item \code{BP} (Base pair position)
\item \code{A1} (Minor allele)
\item \code{tstat} (t-statistics for effect-size test)
\item \code{P} (p-value) and
\item \code{adjP} (Bonferroni corrected p-value)
}
}
\description{
This function uses the GWAS summary statistics from sex-stratified tests like "FMstratified", to evaluate
the difference in effect size between males and females at each SNP using a t-test.

The input dataframes should only include X-chromosome in order to obtain results for sex differences based solely
on X-linked loci.

data("Mfile", package = "GXwasR")
data("Ffile", package = "GXwasR")
Difftest <- SexDiff(Mfile, Ffile)
significant_snps <- Difftest[Difftest$adjP < 0.05, ]
