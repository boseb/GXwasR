\arguments{
\item{DataDir}{Character string for the file path of the input PLINK binary files.}

\item{ResultDir}{Character string for the folder path where the outputs will be saved.}

\item{finput}{Character string, specifying the prefix of the input PLINK binary files with both male and female samples.
This file needs to be in \code{DataDir}.

Note: Case/control phenotypes are expected to be encoded as 1=unaffected (control), 2=affected (case); 0 is accepted as
an alternate missing value encoding. The missing case/control or quantitative phenotypes are expected to be encoded as 'NA'/'nan'
(any capitalization) or -9.}

\item{trait}{Boolean value, 'binary' or 'quantitative' for the phenotype i.e. the trait.}

\item{standard_beta}{Boolean value, \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} in case of quantitative trait for standardizing the trait or phenotype values
(mean 0, unit variance), so the resulting coefficients will be standardized. The default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{xmodel}{Models "FMcombx01","FMcombx02",and "FMstatrified" can be chosen for both binary and quantitative traits
while "GWAcxci" can only apply to the binary trait. These models take care of the X-chromosomal marker.
Three female genotypes are coded by 0, 1, and 2 in FM01 and FM02. The two genotypes of males that follow the
X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) pattern as random (XCI-R) in the FM01 model are coded by 0 and 1, while the two
genotypes that follow the XCI is escaped (XCI-E) in the FM02 model are coded by 0 and 1. To reflect the dose
compensation connection between the sexes, FM02 treats men as homozygous females.

In the FM01comb and FM01comb methods, associations are tested separately for males and females with the FM01 and FM02
models, respectively, and then the combined p values are computed the Fisher's method, Fisher's method with permutation,
or Stouffer's method(1,3-7]. An X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) pattern, or coding technique for X-chromosomal genotypes
between sexes, is not required for the XCGA. By simultaneously accounting for four distinct XCI patterns, namely XCI-R, XCI-E,
XCI-SN (XCI fully toward normal allele), and XCI-SR (XCI fully toward risk allele), this model may maintain a
respectably high power \insertCite{Su2022}{GXwasR}.

Note: \code{sex} shouldn't be provided as a covariate in the XCGA model.}

\item{sex}{Boolean value, \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} for using sex as covariate in association test. It is applicable genome-wide.

The default is FALSE.}

\item{xsex}{Boolean value, \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} for using sex as covariate in association test for X-chromosomal SNPs.
The default is FALSE. This will overwrite 'sex' argument for X-chromosome.}

\item{covarfile}{Character string for the full name of the covariate file in .txt format. This file should be placed in \code{DataDir}.

Note about the covariate file: The first column of this file should be \code{FID}, the second column should be \code{IID} and
the other columns should be covariates. The primary header line should be there starting with “FID”, and “IID”
followed by covariate names. If an individual is not present in the covariate file, or if the individual has a
missing phenotype value (i.e. -9 by default) for the covariate, then that individual is set to missing (i.e. will
be excluded from association analysis). It is important to note that for statrified GWAS model, if PCs are included
as covar then it should be generated separately for each cohort and then included in the covarfile. Use the function
\code{\link{DummyCovar}} to generate a new covariate file with categorical variables down-coded as binary dummy variables for
the covariate file with categorical variables. For instance, if a variable has K categories, K-1 new dummy variables
are constructed, and the original covariate is now estimated with a coefficient for each category.}

\item{interaction}{Boolean value, \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} for including SNP x covariate interaction term/terms from the association analysis.
The default is \code{FALSE}. If a permutation procedure is chosen then the interaction will be automatically \code{FALSE}. For the
interaction with the two covariates COV1 and COV2, the model will look like: \eqn{Y = b0 + b1.ADD + b2.COV1 + b3.COV2 +
b4.ADD x COV1 + b5.ADD x COV2 + e}. When interaction factors are incorporated into the model, the main effects'
significance is not always determined simply; rather, it depends on the arbitrary coding of the variables. To put it
another way, you should probably just interpret the p-value for the interaction. Also, The p-values for the covariates
do not represent the test for the SNP-phenotype association after controlling for the covariate. That is the first row
(ADD). Rather, the covariate term is the test associated with the covariate-phenotype association. These p-values might
be extremely significant (e.g. if one covaries for smoking in an analysis of heart disease, etc) but this does not mean
that the SNP has a highly significant effect necessarily. Note that, this feature is not valid for XCGA model for XWAS part.}

\item{covartest}{Vector value with \code{NULL},"ALL" or covarite name/names to be included in the test. The default is \code{NULL.} For instance,
the user can choose “AGE” and “SEX” as covartest = c(“AGE”, “SEX”) or all the covariates as covartest = c(“ALL”).}

\item{Inphenocov}{Vector of integer values starting from 1 to extract the terms which user wants from the above model:
\eqn{Y = b0 + b1.ADD + b2.COV1 + b3.COV2 + b4.ADDxCOV1 + b5.ADDxCOV2 + e}. The terms will appear in order as
\insertCite{Purcell2007}{GXwasR} for ADD, \insertCite{Su2022}{GXwasR} for COV1, \insertCite{Rhodes2002}{GXwasR} for ADD x COV1,
and \insertCite{Moreau2003}{GXwasR} for ADD x COV2. If the user wants to extract the terms for COV1 and ADD x COV1, they need to specify it as c(2,4).
The default is \verb{c(“ALL”)}.

Note: This feature is not valid for the XCGA model for the XWAS part.}

\item{combtest}{Character vector specifying method for combining p-values for stratified GWAS with FM01comb and FM02comb XWAS models.
Choices are “stouffer.method”, "fisher.method" and "fisher.method.perm". For fisher.method the function for combining
p-values uses a statistic, \eqn{S = -2 ∑^k /log p}, which follows a \eqn{χ^2} distribution with 2k degrees of freedom \insertCite{Fisher1925}{GXwasR}.

For fisher.method.perm, using p-values from stratified tests, the summary statistic for combining p-values is \eqn{S = -2 ∑ /log p}.
A p-value for this statistic can be derived by randomly generating summary statistics \insertCite{Rhodes2002}{GXwasR}. Therefore, a p-value is randomly
sampled from each contributing study, and a random statistic is calculated. The fraction of random statistics greater or
equal to S then gives the final p-value.

For stouffer.method ,the function applies Stouffer’s method \insertCite{Stouffer1949}{GXwasR} to the p-values assuming that the p-values to be combined are
independent. Letting p1, p2, . . . , pk denote the individual (one- or two-sided) p-values of the k hypothesis tests to be
combined, the test statistic is then computed with \eqn{$z = ∑^k_{1}frac{z_{i}}{sqrt(k)}$} where \eqn{$z_{i}$ = Φ−1 (1 – $p_{i}$)} and
\eqn{Φ −1 (·)} denotes the inverse of the cumulative distribution function of a standard normal distribution. Under the joint null
hypothesis, the test statistic follows a standard normal distribution which is used to compute the combined p-value. This
functionality is taken from the R package poolr \insertCite{Cinar2022}{GXwasR}.

Note that only p-values between 0 and 1 are allowed to be passed to these methods.}

\item{MF.zero.sub}{Small numeric value for substituting p-values of 0 in in stratified GWAS with FM01comb and FM02comb XWAS models.
The default is 0.00001. As log(0) results in Inf this replaces p-values of 0 by default with a small float.}

\item{B}{Integer value specifying the number of permutation in case of using fisher.method.perm method in stratified GWAS with
FM01comb and FM02comb XWAS models. The default is 10000.}

\item{MF.mc.cores}{Number of cores used for fisher.method.perm in stratified GWAS with FM01comb and FM02comb XWAS models.}

\item{MF.na.rm}{Boolean value, \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} for removing p-values of NA in stratified GWAS with FM01comb and FM02comb XWAS
in case of using Fisher’s and Stouffer’s methods. The default is FALSE.}

\item{MF.p.corr}{Character vector specifying method for correcting the summary p-values for FMfcomb and FMscomb models. Choices
are "bonferroni", "BH" and "none" for Bonferroni,  Benjamini-Hochberg and none, respectively. The default is "none".}

\item{plot.jpeg}{Boolean value, \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} for saving the plots in .jpeg file. The default is TRUE.}

\item{plotname}{A character string specifying the prefix of the file for plots. This file will be saved in DataDir. The default is
"GXwas.plot".}

\item{snp_pval}{Numeric value as p-value threshold for annotation. SNPs below this p-value will be annotated on the plot. The default
is 1e-08.}

\item{annotateTopSnp}{Boolean value, \code{TRUE} or 'FALSE. If TRUE, it only annotates the top hit on each chromosome that is below the
snp_pval threshold. The default is FALSE.}

\item{suggestiveline}{The default is 5 (for p-value 1e-05).}

\item{genomewideline}{The default is 7.3 (for p-value 5e-08).}

\item{ncores}{Integer value, specifying the number of cores for parallel processing. The default is 0 (no parallel computation).}

\value{
A dataframe with GWAS (with XWAS for X-chromosomal variants) along with Manhattan and Q-Q plots.
In the case of the stratified test, the return is a list containing three dataframes, namely, FWAS, MWAS, and MFWAS with association
results in only female, only male, and both cohorts, respectively. This will be accompanied by Miami and Q-Q plots. The individual manhattan
and Q-Q-plots for stratified tests prefixed with xmodel type will be in the DataDir.
}
\description{
This function runs GWAS models in autosomes with several alternative XWAS models.
Models such as "FMcombx01","FMcombx02",and "FMstatrified" can be applied to both binary and quantitative traits,
while "GWAcxci" can only be applied to a binary trait.

For binary and quantitative features, this function uses logistic and linear regression,
allowing for multiple covariates and the interactions with those covariates in a multiple-regression approach.
These models are all run using the additive effects of SNPs, and each additional minor allele's influence
is represented by the direction of the regression coefficient.

This function attempts to identify the multi-collinearity among predictors by displaying NA for the test statistic
and a p-value for all terms in the model. The more terms you add, the more likely you are to run into issues.

For details about the different XWAS model, please follow the associated publication.
