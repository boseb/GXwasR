\usage{
GXWASmiami(
  ResultDir = tempdir(),
  FemaleWAS,
  MaleWAS,
  snp_pval = 1e-08,
  Xchr = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ResultDir}{Character string for the folder path where the outputs will be saved.}

\item{FemaleWAS}{R dataframe of summary statistics of GWAS or XWAS of female samples with four columns, SNP(Variant),CHR(Chromosome number)
,POS(Base pair position) and pvalue(P-value of the test). This can be generated by running FM01comb or
FM02comb model with GXWAS function.}

\item{MaleWAS}{R dataframe of summary statistics of GWAS or XWAS of male samples with four columns, SNP(Variant),CHR(Chromosome number)
,POS(Base pair position) and pvalue(P-value of the test). This can be generated by running FM01comb or
FM02comb model with GXWAS function.}

\item{snp_pval}{Numeric value as p-value threshold for annotation. SNPs below this p-value will be annotated on the plot. The default is 1e-08.}

\item{Xchr}{Boolean value, TRUE or FALSE, specifying whether to generate Miami plot for stratified XWAS or not. The default is TRUE.}
