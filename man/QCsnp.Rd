}
\arguments{
\item{DataDir}{A character string for the file path of the input PLINK binary files.}

\item{ResultDir}{A character string for the file path where all output files will be stored. The default is tempdir().}

\item{finput}{Character string, specifying the prefix of the input PLINK binary files with both male and female samples. This file needs to be in DataDir.}

\item{foutput}{Character string, specifying the prefix of the output PLINK binary files if the filtering option for the SNPs is chosen. The default is "FALSE".}

\item{casecontrol}{Boolean value, 'TRUE' or 'FALSE' indicating if the input plink files has cases-control status or not. The default is FALSE.}

\item{hweCase}{Numeric value between 0 to 1 or NULL for removing SNPs which fail Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for cases. The default is NULL.}

\item{hweControl}{Numeric value between 0 to 1 or NULL for removing SNPs which fail Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for controls. The default is NULL.}

\item{hwe}{Numeric value between 0 to 1 or NULL for removing SNPs which fail Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for entire dataset. The default is NULL.}

\item{maf}{Numeric value between 0 to 1 for removing SNPs with minor allele frequency less than the specified threshold. The default is 0.05.}

\item{geno}{Numeric value between 0 to 1 for removing SNPs that have less than the specified call rate. The default is 0.05. Users can set this as NULL for not applying this filter.}

\item{monomorphicSNPs}{Boolean value, 'TRUE' or 'FALSE' for filtering out monomorphic SNP. The default is "TRUE".}

\item{caldiffmiss}{Boolean value, 'TRUE' or 'FALSE', specifying whether to compute differential missingness between cases and controls for each SNP (threshold is 0.05/length(unique(No. of. SNPs in the test))). The default is TRUE.}

\item{diffmissFilter}{Boolean value, 'TRUE' or 'FALSE', specifying whether to filter out the SNPs or only flagged them for differential missingness in cases vs contols. The deafailt is "TRUE".}

\item{dmissX}{Boolean value, 'TRUE' or 'FALSE' for computing differential missingness between cases and controls for X chromosome SNPs only. The default is "FALSE". The diffmissFilter will work for all these SNPs.}

\item{dmissAutoY}{Boolean value, 'TRUE' or 'FALSE' for computing differential missingness between cases and controls for SNPs on autosomes and Y chromosome only. The default is "FALSE". If dmissX and dmissAutoY are both FALSE, then this will be computed genome-wide. The diffmissFilter will work for all these SNPs.}

\item{highLD_regions}{A dataframe with known high LD regions. A dataframe from Anderson et. al, 2010 (3) is provided with the package.}

\item{ld_prunning}{Boolean value, 'TRUE' or 'FALSE' for applying linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based filtering.}

\item{window_size}{Integer value, specifying a window size in the variant counts for LD-based filtering. The default is 50.}

\item{step_size}{Integer value, specifying a variant count to shift the window at the end of each step for LD filtering. The default is 5.}

\item{r2_threshold}{Numeric value between 0 to 1 of pairwise r^2 threshold for LD-based filtering. The default is 0.02.}
}
\value{
A list of two objects, namely, MonomorSNPs and DiffMissSNPs containing monomorphic SNPs and SNPs with differential missingness in cases vs controls, respectively. Output plink binary files in the working directory.
}
\description{
This function performs quality control on genetic variant data from PLINK binary files. It filters variants based on parameters like minor allele frequency, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, call rate, and differential missingness between cases and controls. It also handles monomorphic SNPs and applies linkage disequilibrium-based filtering if specified.
