\title{FilterRegion: Filter chromosomal regions.}
\usage{
FilterRegion(
  DataDir,
  ResultDir,
  finput,
  foutput,
  CHRX = TRUE,
  CHRY = FALSE,
  filterPAR = TRUE,
  filterXTR = TRUE,
  filterAmpliconic = TRUE,
  regionfile = FALSE,
  filterCHR = NULL,
  Hg = "19",
  exclude = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{DataDir}{A character string for the file path of the input PLINK binary files.}

\item{ResultDir}{A character string for the file path where all output files will be stored. The default is tempdir().}

\item{finput}{Character string, specifying the prefix of the input PLINK binary files.}

\item{foutput}{Character string, specifying the prefix of the output PLINK binary files if the filtering option for the SNPs is chosen. The default is "FALSE".}

\item{CHRX}{Boolean value, 'TRUE' or 'FALSE' to filter/flag regions from chromosome X. The default is TRUE. Note: CHRX only in effect if one of PAR, XTR or Ampliconic filter is in effect.}

\item{CHRY}{Boolean value, 'TRUE' or 'FALSE' to filter/flag regions from chromosome X. The default is FALSE. Note: CHRY only in effect if one of PAR, XTR or Ampliconic filter is in effect.}

\item{filterPAR}{Boolean value, 'TRUE' or 'FALSE' to filter out PARs from input plink file. The default is TRUE.}

\item{filterXTR}{Boolean value, 'TRUE' or 'FALSE' to filter out XTRs from input plink file. The default is TRUE.}

\item{filterAmpliconic}{Boolean value, 'TRUE' or 'FALSE' to filter out Ampliconic regions from input plink file. The default is TRUE.}

\item{regionfile}{Character string, specifying the name of the .txt file containing the user-defined regions to be filtered out from input plink file in bed format. The default is FALSE. If regionfile = TRUE, only this filtering will be in effect. Also, PAR, XTR and Ampliconic SNPs from X-chomosome will be flagged and returned.}

\item{filterCHR}{Vector value with positive integer, specifying the chromosome code to filter/flag the SNPs. The default is 0, means no filtering based on chromosome code. For non-zero values of this argument, the function will only consider the chromosome code to filter or flag. All other filtering will not work. If filterCHR = TRUE, only this filtering will be in effect. Also, PAR, XTR and Ampliconic SNPs from X-chomosome will be flagged and returned.}

\item{Hg}{Character value, '19', or '38', specifying which genome build to use for PAR, XTR and Ampliconic regions. The default is Hg = "19".}

\item{exclude}{Boolean value, 'TRUE' or 'FALSE' to filter and flag or only flag the SNPs. The default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A list of three dataframes: PAR containing SNPs from PAR regions; XTR containing SNPs from XTR region and Ampliconic containing SNPs from Ampliconic region.

For non-zero value of filterCHR, a dataframe containing the excluded/flagged SNPs will be returned.

For exclude = TRUE, two sets of plink binary files will be produced in ResultDir. One set will have the remaining SNPs after filtering and other one will have the discarded SNPs.

\description{
Filtering Pseudo-Autosomal Region (PAR), X-transposed region (XTR), Ampliconic, filter based on chromosome code or user-defined regions from input plink files.Only one type of filtering can be done from three types, either by region (using regionfile = TRUE), by chromosome (filterCHR) or by any combination of these three, filterPAR, XTR and Ampliconic.
